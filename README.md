# Data-Stractures-DAS-

Data Stracture contains a description of stack and tuples and how operations are performed.

## Stacks

Stack is a linear data-stracture that follows the last-in-first out principle.Stack is implemented through Array or Linked list.Adding elements to a stack is called 'push' operation while removing elements from a stack is called 'pop' operation. Elements in a stack are accessed through indexing.

## Tuples

A tuple is an ordered sequence of elements that is immutable which means, the values within the tuple cannot be modified.Elements in a tuple can be accessed through their index inside a square bracket following the tuple name.
